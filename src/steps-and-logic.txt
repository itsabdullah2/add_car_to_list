- PLANS
-- Form Section
--- Input field for car name
--- Input field for car cost
--- Button to submit the info of the car
-- Car List Section & Search Input
--- the list contains rows each row has the name, cost of the car and the delete button
-- Value section
--- That contains the cost of the all cars in the car lists
// The Logic
-- The searching field filtering the existing cars
-- When I enter the name of existing car in the car list that added car will be bold

// THE COMPONENTS THAT I'LL USE
--- CarForm
--- CarList
--- CarValue
--- CarSearch

// THE STRUCTURE OF THE STORE AND SLICES FILES
-- I'll create tow slices:
--- First: Form slice
---- Action: carName, carCost
----- carName => for the name of the car
----- carCost => for the cost of the car
--- Second: Car List Slice
---- Action: changeSearchTerm, removeCar, addCar
----- changeSearchTerm => for filtering the car list for the exiting car
----- removeCar => to the delete button to delete the car from the list of cars
----- addCar => to add the car from the submit button from the submit button in the form section
